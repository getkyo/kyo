# kernel2 backlog

Queues: implementing, designing, awaiting ruling, next up, parked. Each item carries
its own context so it reads without the linked docs; the docs carry the full designs.
Done work is removed once acked. Last update: 2026-08-13.

## Done, awaiting your ack (removed from the file once acked)

(empty: everything acked has been removed)

## Implementing now

## Next up

## Parked (your call to revive)

### Bracket primitive

Context: acquire/use/release with the fixed contract: use fully interruptible; no
interruption between acquire finishing and use starting; release always executes
(normal completion, exception unwind, and discard of an interrupted fiber's
remainder) and runs to completion once started. Ruled: not served via Isolate
(release on a short-circuit that truncates the owning region is the inexpressible
core). IOTask adds R-B1 (discard entry synchronous, Unit), R-B2 (a throw escaping a
partial drive already ran what it unwound), R-B3 (a done-truncation runs the
discarded regions' releases).

Three designs on disk, judgment deferred by your call. `bracket-node-design.md`: a
`Kyo.Bracket` node that exists exactly when the resource exists; acquire chains into
one strict transform that reads the resource and allocates obligation and node with
no budget check between, so the gap closes by representation, no mask, effectful
acquire included; weakness: a captured continuation carrying a bracket segment is a
value fork. `bracket-handler-design.md`: a handler kind whose region state
accumulates obligations via a register op; Scope becomes a direct instance; needs a
mask region for the gap; weakness: taxes the handler-stack walk for every open
region's lifetime plus a round trip per resource. `bracket-effect-design.md` (the
probe): the contract is not expressible in the current algebra; the minimal kernel
assist is a per-cell disposal hook over truncation-discarded regions plus one catch
at the evaluator boundary; everything else in the siblings is convenience. When
revived, the ruling should decide that shared disposal walk explicitly (consumers:
bracket unwind, R-B3 truncation, enrichment frames).

### kyo-bench arena rows, old vs new kernel (task #8)

Context: kyo-bench holds the end-to-end arena benchmarks (the cross-framework rows).
Running them over both kernels is the test of whether the micro-board positions
matter in realistic workloads. Blocked regardless on the stack above the kernel
compiling against kernel2, so parking costs nothing today.

### Effect.catching as a region

Context: `Effect.catching(v)(recover)` is the kernel's failure-recovery combinator.
Its current mechanism, `guarded`, rewrites the computation as it runs: every resumed
step gets wrapped in a fresh guard arrow and every node that comes back is
re-allocated with a guarded exit, which is your TODO at Effect.scala:27 ("an
expensive workaround for something that should be handled in Eval or Arrow?"). The
analysis confirmed the cost (one guard allocation, one node re-allocation, and one
chain flatten per resumed step) and a semantic hole: the rewrite reaches region
exits but not region interiors, so a throw inside a nested handled region is not
recovered, which nothing in the API suggests.

Design: make the catching scope a region: a `Kyo.Caught` node holding value, recover,
and exit, entered like any region and popped through its exit; the failure path finds
the innermost catching region by walking the handler stack at the throw point.
Catching becomes one allocation; `guarded` and its per-node-kind arms are deleted;
the nested-interior hole closes because a nested region sits inside the catching
region on the same stack. A plain evaluator try cannot do this because a guarded
residual recovered in a second drive is pinned behavior: the scope must be a value
that parks and rebuilds, and a region is the only such structure.
(`kernel2-todos-design.md` section 1.)

Parked by your call ("not sure about this region thing"). If revived, it consumes the
same failure-path walk the bracket ruling decides.

### Defaulted redesign (optional context)
FB double check the design and explain it to me in a reply in th econsole using code snippets to explain
Context: `Kyo.Defaulted` is the optional-context mechanism: a suspension that carries
its own fallback, which the evaluator's find-miss arm answers with when no handler is
installed (`Local.get` works with no `Local.let` in scope because of it). Your TODO
at KyoInternal.scala:38 rejects it, and the diagnosis agrees: the fallback is typed
`Any`, the row claims an effect that may never dispatch to a handler, and the second
consumer (the definedness probe that `Env.run`'s union and `Local.let`'s merge need)
only exists because the old kernel's Context map, which answered "is there an outer
handler" with a map lookup, was deleted.

Design: split the two needs. Context answers carry their own definedness:
`ContextEffect[+A] extends ArrowEffect[Const[Unit], Const[Maybe[A]]]`, so the probe
becomes an ordinary read. The optional fallback becomes a typed marker (`unhandled:
O[X]` on the suspension) replacing Defaulted in the find-miss arm, typed at the
operation's output instead of `Any`. (`kernel2-todos-design.md` section 3; parked
task #31's discussion input. Interacts with the ContextEffect isolation design in
flight: its capture reads change shape if this lands.)

### IOTask integration

Context: IOTask is the scheduler's task, driving a fiber's computation in preemptible
slices and owning interruption, completion, and the finalizer contract. The port to
kernel2 is designed in full and re-verified against the current kernel (r2): the
fiber boundary is a handler region installed outermost, so a parked re-raise leaves a
bare residual that `handlePartial` re-enters without nesting a second layer; the park
must be written as a pending outcome (the settled form, one character away, spins);
the field layout lands at baseline parity (32 bytes).

Status: parked. Its rulings when revived: R1 (a deadline parameter on `Eval.partial`,
without which single-threaded platforms cannot preempt a fiber that never suspends),
R2 (charge the settled-answer arm one budget step so answer-loops like `Async.Join`
over completed promises become preemptible; hot arm, JMH-gated), R3 (abandoned
releases run synchronously, Unit-returning; recommended), R4 (context stays a def on
a conditional subclass so the footprint trick survives), R5 (dispatchFirst; now in
implementation), R6 (below). (`iotask-kernel2-integration-r2.md`; summary
`backlog-sections/iotask.md`.)

/** Provides mechanisms for handling pending effects when forking computations.
  *
  * Isolate enables proper state management across execution boundaries like fibers, parallel operations, and detached computations. When
  * forking execution, effects need special handling to prevent state leakage, ensure consistency, and determine what effects are available
  * after the fork completes.
  *
  * The abstraction uses three type parameters to precisely control effect flow:
  *   - `Remove`: Effects that will be satisfied (handled) by the isolation
  *   - `Keep`: Effects that remain available during isolated execution
  *   - `Restore`: Effects that become available after isolation completes
  *
  * This design unifies two categories of state management:
  *
  * **Simple State Copying** is used for [[ContextEffect]]s, which store their state in a format that can be directly copied from the
  * original computation to the forked one. These are effects like environment variables, configuration settings, or local values - pieces
  * of state that can simply be copied as-is when the computation forks.
  *
  * **Complex State Management** handles effects that require structured transformation. When forking a computation with these effects, the
  * isolation:
  *
  *   1. Captures a snapshot of the current state
  *   2. Transforms that state during isolated execution
  *   3. Restores the transformed state when the fork completes
  *
  * ==Operations==
  *
  * Operations specify their isolation requirements through the type parameters. For example:
  *   - `Fiber.init` requires `Isolate[S, Sync, S2]` - only Sync effects available during initialization
  *   - `Async.parallel` might use `Isolate[S, Abort[E] & Async, S]` - async operations available, same effects restored
  *
  * The distinction between `Remove` and `Restore` is crucial: it allows operations to transform effects during isolation. A fiber might
  * capture `Var[Int]` effects but only restore the final value, not intermediate updates.
  *
  * Most effects provide implicit instances based on their state management needs. Some effects like Var and Emit provide multiple
  * strategies through a dedicated isolate object, allowing users to choose between updating final values, merging changes, or keeping
  * modifications local.
  *
  * For effect intersections like (Env[Config] & Var[State]), instances are automatically derived if each component effect has an instance.
  *
  * ==Explicit Composition==
  *
  * While automatic derivation works for most cases, you can explicitly compose isolate instances for precise control over state handling:
  * {{{
  *  // Compose specific isolation strategies
  *  val isolate =
  *     Var.isolate.update[Int]                         // Update final Int value
  *         .andThen(Emit.isolate.merge[String])        // Preserve String emissions
  *
  *  // Use in operations that accept isolation
  *  isolate.use {
  *    Async.parallel(parallelism)(tasks)
  *  }
  * }}}
  *
  * This explicit composition is useful when:
  *
  *   1. The order of state capture/restore matters
  *   2. You need specific isolation strategies for each effect
  *   3. The default derived instance doesn't handle effects as desired
  *
  * **Important**: Effects that short circuit execution like Abort and Choice should not provide isolation since the ordering of the
  * handling in the automatic derivation could produce different results depending on which effect is handled first.
  *
  * @tparam Remove
  *   Effects that will be satisfied (handled) by the isolation
  * @tparam Keep
  *   Effects that remain available during isolated execution
  * @tparam Restore
  *   Effects that become available after isolation completes

                        |
                        |You have a few options, from simplest to most advanced:
                        |
                        |1. Handle these effects before the operation:
                        |   Async.parallel(parallelism)(tasks.map(MyEffect.run(_)))
                        |
                        |2. Some effects like Var and Emit provide options through their isolate object:
                        |   Var.isolate.update[Int].use {
                        |     Async.parallel(parallelism)(tasks)
                        |   }
                        |
                        |3. For multiple effects, compose isolates with andThen:
                        |   Var.isolate.update[Int]
                        |     .andThen(Emit.isolate.merge[String])
                        |     .use {
                        |       Async.parallel(parallelism)(tasks)
                        |     }
                        |
                        |4. For custom state management:
                        |   val isolate = new Isolate.Stateful[MyEffect, Any] {
                        |     type State = MyState        // Your effect's state
                        |     type Transform[A] = (State, A)
                        |     ...
                        |   }
                        |   isolate.use {
                        |     Async.parallel(parallelism)(tasks)
                        |   }
                        |""".stripMargin

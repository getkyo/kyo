/** Provides mechanisms for handling pending effects when forking computations.
  *
  * Isolate provide two ways to handle state isolation, each designed for a specific category of effects:
  *
  * [[Contextual]] isolation is designed for [[ContextEffect]]s, which store their state in a simple format that can be directly copied from
  * the original computation to the forked one. These are effects like environment variables, configuration settings, or local values -
  * pieces of state that can simply be copied as-is when the computation forks.
  *
  * [[Stateful]] isolation handles effects with more complex state that requires structured management. When forking a computation with
  * these effects, the solution needs to:
  *
  *   1. Capture a snapshot of the current state
  *   2. Transform that state during isolated execution
  *   3. Merge the transformed state back when the fork completes
  *
  * ==Operations==
  *
  * Operations determine which isolation capability they require. Some operations like Async.run require Contextual isolation to enable the
  * forked computation to execute to completion, while others like Async.parallel allow Stateful isolation given that the return type allows
  * restoring forked effects after the parallel execution finishes. The choice between Contextual and Stateful isolation is made by the
  * operation, not the user.
  *
  * Most effects provide implicit instances based on their state management needs. Some effects like Var and Emit provide multiple
  * strategies through a dedicated isolate object, allowing users to choose between updating final values, merging changes, or keeping
  * modifications local.
  *
  * For effect intersections like (Env[Config] & Var[State]), instances are automatically derived if each component effect has an instance.
  * Stateful isolation subsumes Contextual - if any effect needs Stateful isolation, the derived instance will be Stateful since it can
  * handle both simple copying and complex state management.
  *
  * ==Explicit Composition==
  *
  * While automatic derivation works for most cases, you can explicitly compose isolate instances for precise control over state handling:
  * {{{
  *  // Compose specific isolation strategies
  *  val isolate =
  *     Var.isolate.update[Int]                         // Update final Int value
  *         .andThen(Emit.isolate.merge[String])        // Preserve String emissions
  *
  *  // Use in operations that accept Stateful isolation
  *  isolate.use {
  *    Async.parallel(parallelism)(tasks)
  *  }
  * }}}
  *
  * This explicit composition is useful when:
  *
  *   1. The order of state capture/restore matters
  *   2. You need specific isolation strategies for each effect
  *   3. The default derived instance doesn't handle effects as desired
  *
  * **Important**: Effects that short circuit execution like Abort and Choice should not provide isolation since the ordering of the
  * handling in the automatic derivation could produce different results depending on which effect is handled first.
  *
  * @tparam Retain
  *   Effects that will be satisfied (handled) by the isolation

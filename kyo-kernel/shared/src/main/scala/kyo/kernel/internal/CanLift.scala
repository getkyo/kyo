@implicitNotFound("""
Type '${A}' may contain a nested effect computation.
This usually means you have a value of type `X < S1 < S2` (i.e. `(X < S1) < S2`) where a plain value `X < S` is expected.

This often happens due to *type inference*: some effect computations are nested when chaining operations, and Scala infers a value with nested effects instead of merging them.

To fix this, you can:

1. Call `.flatten` to merge the nested effects:
    val x: (Int < S1) < S2 = ...
    val y: Int < (S1 & S2) = x.flatten


   This collapses the nested effect layers into a single computation with a combined effect set.

2. Split the computation into multiple statements:
   Breaking the code into smaller expressions helps Scala infer the correct types incrementally, avoiding nested effects.
    val x: Int < S1 = computeFirst()
    val y: Int < S2 = useResult(x)

/** Validation effect for asserting conditions during computation.
  *
  * The `Check` effect provides a functional alternative to traditional assertions, enabling runtime validation of conditions within the Kyo
  * effect system. Unlike exceptions that immediately halt execution, checks can be collected, transformed, or handled in various ways
  * without disrupting the control flow.
  *
  * Checks create a `CheckFailed` instance when a condition isn't met, capturing both a message and the frame location where the failure
  * occurred. This rich error context makes debugging easier by providing precise information about what failed and where.
  *
  * Three handling strategies give flexibility in how validation failures are processed:
  *   - Collecting all failures for later inspection
  *   - Converting failures to the `Abort` effect for immediate error propagation
  *   - Discarding failures for non-critical validations
  *
  * The effect supports parallel computations where it can accumulate multiple failures across branches rather than short-circuiting on the
  * first error, enabling more comprehensive validation reporting.
  *
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Check.require]] for creating conditional checks
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Check.runChunk]] for collecting all failures during execution
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Check.runAbort]] for converting failures to the Abort effect
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Check.runDiscard]] for ignoring check failures

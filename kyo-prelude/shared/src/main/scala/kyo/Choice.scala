/** Represents non-deterministic computations with multiple possible outcomes.
  *
  * The `Choice` effect enables branching computations where multiple paths can be explored simultaneously. Unlike traditional control flow
  * that follows a single execution path, Choice allows expressing alternative possibilities that can be collected and processed together.
  *
  * Choice is valuable for scenarios requiring exploration of multiple alternatives, such as parsing with backtracking, search algorithms,
  * or any computation where you need to model decisions with multiple valid options. When combined with other effects like `Parse`, it
  * becomes especially powerful for expressing complex branching logic.
  *
  * The primary operations include introducing choice points with `get`, evaluating functions across alternatives with `eval`, and pruning
  * invalid paths with `drop`. Computations using Choice can be collected with `run`, which gathers all successful outcomes into a single
  * sequence, or streamed with `runStream`, which produces results incrementally as a stream.
  *
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Choice.get]] for introducing choice points from sequences
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Choice.eval]] for applying functions to multiple alternatives
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Choice.drop]] for terminating unsuccessful computation branches
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Choice.run]] for collecting all possible outcomes
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Choice.runStream]] for streaming possible outcomes incrementally

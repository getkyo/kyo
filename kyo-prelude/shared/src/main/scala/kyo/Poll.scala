/** Represents polling values from a data source with backpressure control.
  *
  * Poll is used to consume values while maintaining flow control through acknowledgements. Each poll operation takes an Ack that determines
  * how many values can be consumed, and returns Maybe[V] indicating whether a value was available.
  *
  * Key behaviors:
  *   - Each poll operation requires an Ack value that signals the consumer's readiness to receive more data
  *   - Poll returns Maybe[V], where:
  *     - Present(v) indicates a successful poll with value v
  *     - Absent indicates the end of the stream (no more values will be available)
  *   - Once Absent is received, the consumer should stop polling as the stream has terminated
  *   - Backpressure is maintained through the Ack responses:
  *     - Continue signals readiness to receive more values
  *     - Stop indicates the consumer wants to pause receiving values
  *
  * The effect enables building streaming data pipelines with controlled consumption rates. Handlers can process values at their own pace by
  * returning appropriate Ack responses, while respecting stream termination signals.
  *
  * @tparam V
  *   The type of values being polled from the data source.

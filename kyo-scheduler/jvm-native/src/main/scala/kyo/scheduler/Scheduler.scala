/** A high-performance task scheduler with adaptive concurrency control and admission regulation.
  *
  * The scheduler provides a foundation for concurrent task execution with features including dynamic worker pool sizing, admission control
  * to prevent overload, work stealing for load balancing, task preemption, and comprehensive performance monitoring.
  *
  * ==Worker Management==
  *
  * The scheduler maintains a pool of worker threads that execute tasks. The number of workers adjusts dynamically between configured
  * minimum and maximum bounds based on system load and performance metrics. Workers can steal tasks from each other to balance load across
  * the pool, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
  *
  * ==Admission Control==
  *
  * An admission regulator prevents system overload by selectively rejecting tasks when the system shows signs of congestion. The admission
  * rate adjusts automatically based on measured queuing delays, providing natural backpressure that helps maintain system stability under
  * varying loads.
  *
  * ==Concurrency Control==
  *
  * A concurrency regulator continuously monitors system scheduling efficiency through sophisticated timing measurements. By analyzing
  * scheduling delays and system load, it dynamically adjusts the worker pool size to maintain optimal performance. The regulator detects
  * both under-utilization and thread interference, scaling the thread count up or down accordingly.
  *
  * ==Thread Blocking and Adaptive Concurrency==
  *
  * The scheduler employs a sophisticated approach to handle thread blocking that requires no explicit signaling or special handling from
  * tasks. Instead of treating blocking as an exceptional case, the system embraces it as a natural part of task execution through its
  * adaptive concurrency mechanism.
  *
  * At its core, the scheduler uses an ephemeral thread model where workers acquire threads from a pool only when actively processing tasks.
  * When a thread becomes blocked, the scheduler detects this through direct thread state inspection and automatically compensates by
  * adjusting its concurrency level. This detection-and-response cycle creates a natural overflow capacity that maintains throughput even
  * when many threads are blocked.
  *
  * The design's effectiveness lies in its transparency: tasks can freely perform blocking operations without concerning themselves with
  * thread management. When blocking occurs, the concurrency regulator observes increased scheduling delays and responds by expanding the
  * worker pool if possible and necessary. As blocked threads resume, the improved scheduling efficiency triggers a gradual reduction in
  * worker count.
  *
  * ==Loom Integration==
  *
  * The scheduler seamlessly integrates with Java's Project Loom virtual threads when available, providing enhanced scalability for
  * I/O-bound workloads. To enable virtual threads, add the JVM argument '--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED' and set
  * '-Dkyo.scheduler.virtualizeWorkers=true'. The scheduler transparently manages virtual thread creation and scheduling through the worker
  * executor.
  *
  * ==Monitoring==
  *
  * Comprehensive metrics about scheduler operation are exposed through JMX and optional console reporting, providing detailed insight into
  * worker utilization, task execution, regulation decisions, and system load.

      *
      * @param cycleIntervalNs
      *   Interval between worker health checks in nanoseconds. Controls how quickly the scheduler detects and responds to stalled or
      *   blocked workers. (-Dkyo.scheduler.cycleIntervalNs=<value>)
      *
      * @param virtualizeWorkers
      *   When true, uses virtual threads from Project Loom instead of platform threads. Beneficial for workloads with significant I/O or
      *   blocking operations. Requires JDK 21+ and appropriate JVM flags. (-Dkyo.scheduler.virtualizeWorkers=<value>)
      *
      * @param enableTopJMX
      *   Exposes scheduler metrics through JMX for monitoring. Useful for observing scheduler behavior in production.
      *   (-Dkyo.scheduler.enableTopJMX=<value>)
      *
      * @param enableTopConsoleMs
      *   Interval in milliseconds for printing scheduler metrics to console. Zero disables console output. Useful for development and
      *   debugging. (-Dkyo.scheduler.enableTopConsoleMs=<value>)

/** A compile-time guarantee that a parametrized opaque type with internal flat encoding doesn't contain instances of itself.
  *
  * When designing opaque types with flat internal encodings like `A | Container[A]` (union types), runtime discrimination between the cases
  * requires that `A` isn't itself another instance of the opaque type. Otherwise, type discrimination would confuse nested instances with
  * direct values, breaking the semantics of operations on the type at runtime.
  *
  * For example, given `opaque type Box[A] = A | Container[A]`, allowing `A` to be another `Box[A]` would make it impossible to reliably
  * distinguish between a direct value and a boxed value through runtime checks.
  *
  * Flat encoding provides better performance by avoiding allocation of a wrapper class object. Since opaque types are erased to `Any` at
  * runtime, primitive types will still be boxed, though modern JIT compilers can often eliminate these transient allocations through
  * speculative optimizations in hot code paths. For non-primitive values, boxing is avoided entirely, reducing memory overhead and
  * improving cache locality.
  *
  * `Flat[A]` enforces this constraint at compile-time through a macro that recursively checks the structure of types:
  *   - For union and intersection types, each component is checked
  *   - For other types, it verifies they have their own `Flat` evidence or are concrete class types, which excludes opaque types
  *   - It fails compilation with a helpful error message when it detects potential nesting issues
  *
  * This ensures the integrity of the flat encoding pattern with union types without runtime overhead.
  *
  * @tparam A
  *   the type to verify does not contain unwanted opaque type nesting

/** Asynchronous computation effect.
  *
  * While IO handles pure effect suspension, Async provides the complete toolkit for concurrent programming - managing fibers, scheduling,
  * and execution control. It includes IO in its effect set, making it a unified solution for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
  *
  * This separation, enabled by Kyo's algebraic effect system, is reflected in the codebase's design: the presence of Async in pending
  * effects signals that a computation may park or involve fiber scheduling, contrasting with IO-only operations that run to completion.
  *
  * Most application code can work exclusively with Async, with the IO/Async distinction becoming relevant primarily in library code or
  * performance-critical sections where precise control over execution characteristics is needed.
  *
  * This effect includes IO in its effect set to handle both async and sync execution in a single effect.

    /** Convenience method for suspending computations in an Async effect.
      *
      * While IO is specifically designed to suspend side effects without handling asynchronicity, Async provides both side effect
      * suspension and asynchronous execution capabilities (fibers, async scheduling). Since Async includes IO in its effect set, this
      * method allows users to work with a single unified effect that handles both concerns.
      *
      * Note that this method only suspends the computation - it does not fork execution into a new fiber. For concurrent execution, use
      * Async.run or combinators like Async.parallel instead.
      *
      * This is particularly useful in application code where the distinction between pure side effects and asynchronous execution is less
      * important than having a simple, consistent way to handle effects. The underlying effects are typically managed together at the
      * application boundary through KyoApp.

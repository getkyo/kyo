/** A synchronization primitive that allows a fixed number of parties to wait for each other to reach a common point of execution.
  *
  * Barrier provides a coordination mechanism where a predetermined number of fibers or threads (parties) must all arrive at a specific
  * synchronization point before any of them can proceed. This is useful for scenarios where concurrent operations must wait for each other
  * to complete before continuing execution.
  *
  * Key characteristics:
  *   - The Barrier is initialized with a specific number of parties
  *   - Each party calls `await` when it reaches the barrier point
  *   - All parties remain blocked until the last party arrives at the barrier
  *   - When the last party arrives, all waiting parties are released simultaneously
  *   - The barrier can only be used once - it cannot be reset after all parties have been released
  *   - If initialized with parties <= 0, the barrier behaves as a no-op (await returns immediately)
  *
  * @see
  *   [[Latch]] A related primitive that allows one or more tasks to wait until a set of operations completes

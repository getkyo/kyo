/** A reactive value that can change over time, providing both synchronous access to its current state and asynchronous notification of
  * changes.
  *
  * Signal provides two fundamental operations:
  *   - `current`: synchronous access to the current value
  *   - `next`: asynchronous notification of the next change
  *
  * Changes can be observed through streaming operations:
  *   - `streamCurrent`: emits the current value continuously
  *   - `streamChanges`: emits only when values change
  *
  * Note that `streamChanges` may skip intermediate values if changes occur faster than they can be processed. This makes it suitable for UI
  * updates or other scenarios where processing only the latest value is acceptable, but not for cases where capturing every single change
  * is critical.
  *
  * The companion object provides these creation methods:
  *   - `Signal.initRef[A]`: creates a mutable `Signal.Ref[A]` initialized with a starting value
  *   - `Signal.initConst[A]`: creates an immutable `Signal[A]` that always returns the same value
  *   - `Signal.initRaw[A]`: (low-level API) creates a custom `Signal[A]` by directly implementing its fundamental operations, primarily
  *     intended for implementing signal combinators and custom signal types
  *
  * @tparam A
  *   The type of value contained in the signal. Must have an instance of `CanEqual[A, A]`

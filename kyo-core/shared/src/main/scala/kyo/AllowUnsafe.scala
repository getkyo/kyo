@implicitNotFound("""
Use of Kyo's unsafe APIs detected! These are intended for low-level usage like in integrations, libraries, and performance-sensitive code.

Options (in order of preference):

1. Receive an implicit AllowUnsafe parameter
   def myFunction(implicit allow: AllowUnsafe) = // unsafe code here

2. Suspend the operation with IO
   IO.Unsafe { // unsafe code here }

3. Import implicit evidence (last resort)
   import AllowUnsafe.embrace.danger
   // unsafe code here

WARNING: Using AllowUnsafe directly bypasses important safety mechanisms and may break referential transparency. Ensure you fully understand the risks before proceeding this way.

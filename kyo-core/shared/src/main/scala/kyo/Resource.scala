/** A structured effect for safe acquisition and finalization of resources.
  *
  * Resource provides a principled mechanism for working with entities that require proper cleanup, ensuring resources are released in a
  * deterministic manner even in the presence of errors or interruptions. This effect is particularly valuable for managing external
  * dependencies with lifecycle requirements such as file handles, network connections, database sessions, or any action that needs a
  * corresponding cleanup step.
  *
  * Key features:
  *   - Automatic resource finalization through `Resource.run` when computations complete or fail
  *   - Compositional API allowing resource dependencies to be built up safely with `acquireRelease` and `acquire`
  *   - Support for parallel cleanup through configurable concurrency levels with `run(closeParallelism)(...)`
  *   - Declarative cleanup registration using `Resource.ensure` for custom finalizers
  *
  * The Resource effect follows the bracket pattern (acquire-use-release) but with improved interruption handling and parallel cleanup
  * capabilities. Resource finalizers registered with `ensure` are guaranteed to run exactly once when the associated scope completes, with
  * failures in finalizers logged rather than thrown to avoid masking the primary computation result.
  *
  * Typically, you would use `acquireRelease` to pair resource acquisition with its cleanup function, then compose multiple resources
  * together before running the combined effect with `Resource.run`.

/** Admission control mechanism that helps prevent system overload by selectively rejecting tasks at the boundary of incoming workload.
  *
  * Designed to be used at system entry points where external requests first arrive (e.g. API endpoints, message consumers, etc.), this
  * mechanism helps maintain system stability under high load. The admission controller maintains a dynamically adjusting admission
  * percentage based on system conditions. When congestion is detected, the admission rate decreases to shed load. As conditions improve,
  * the rate gradually increases to admit more tasks.
  *
  * Tasks can be rejected probabilistically for one-off operations, or deterministically using string/integer keys for consistent admission
  * decisions across related tasks.

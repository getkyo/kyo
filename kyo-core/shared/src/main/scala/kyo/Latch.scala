/** A synchronization primitive that allows one or more tasks to wait until a set of operations being performed in other tasks completes.
  *
  * Latch provides a countdown mechanism where tasks can wait for a counter to reach zero before proceeding. The counter is decremented
  * through `release` operations, with waiting tasks unblocked once the count reaches zero.
  *
  * Latches are commonly used for coordinating startup sequences, signaling completion of distributed work, or implementing simple fork-join
  * patterns where one task must wait for multiple operations to complete.
  *
  * When initialized with count <= 0, the latch behaves as a no-op with all await operations completing immediately.
  *
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Barrier]] A related primitive that synchronizes a fixed number of tasks at a specific execution point

/** A multi-producer, multi-consumer primitive that broadcasts messages to multiple listeners.
  *
  * Hub provides fan-out functionality by delivering each published message to all active listeners. Unlike a regular Channel which delivers
  * messages to a single consumer, Hub enables multiple consumers to receive and process the same messages.
  *
  * Message flow and buffering:
  *   - Publishers send messages to the Hub's main buffer
  *   - A dedicated fiber distributes messages from the Hub buffer to each listener's individual buffer
  *   - Each listener consumes messages from its own buffer at its own pace
  *   - When any listener's buffer becomes full and the Hub's buffer is also full, backpressure is applied to publishers, affecting message
  *     delivery to all listeners
  *
  * @tparam A
  *   The type of messages that can be published through this Hub

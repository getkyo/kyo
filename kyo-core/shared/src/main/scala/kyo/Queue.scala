/** A high-performance, thread-safe queue with configurable concurrency patterns.
  *
  * Queue provides a comprehensive foundation for concurrent data transfer with customizable concurrency patterns (see [[kyo.Access]]).
  * Unlike Channel which focuses on fiber-aware communication, Queue directly exposes a lower-level interface optimized for raw throughput
  * and minimal synchronization overhead.
  *
  * Key features:
  *   - Non-blocking, lock-free implementation (using JCTools on the JVM, with platform-specific implementations elsewhere)
  *   - Different specialized implementations for various producer-consumer patterns
  *   - Bounded capacity (`Queue.init`) with clear backpressure semantics
  *   - Unbounded variants with different overflow strategies:
  *     - Regular unbounded (`Queue.Unbounded.init`): grows as needed without bounds
  *     - Dropping (`Queue.Unbounded.initDropping`): discards new elements when full
  *     - Sliding (`Queue.Unbounded.initSliding`): discards oldest elements when full
  *   - Safe concurrent access with proper failure handling
  *
  * The standard Queue has fixed capacity (bounded), providing natural backpressure. For scenarios requiring dynamic sizing, Queue.Unbounded
  * offers strategies that either grow indefinitely or handle overflow by dropping elements, ensuring operations like offer/poll remain
  * non-blocking even under high load.
  *
  * WARNING: Unbounded queues can lead to memory exhaustion if producers consistently outpace consumers. In production systems, bounded
  * queues or overflow strategies (dropping/sliding) are generally safer choices unless you can guarantee bounded growth.
  *
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Channel]] For a higher-level, fiber-aware communication primitive
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Access]] For available producer-consumer access patterns
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.Queue.Unbounded]] For dynamically-sized queue variant

/** A high-performance accumulator optimized for concurrent updates.
  *
  * LongAdder provides efficient methods for concurrent addition and increment operations by reducing contention between threads. Rather
  * than using a single counter that all threads must atomically update, LongAdder maintains multiple internal counters that are dynamically
  * distributed across threads, which are then combined on read operations.
  *
  * This approach offers significant performance benefits in high-contention scenarios:
  *   - Write operations (add, increment) are extremely fast with minimal thread interference
  *   - Read operations (get) are slightly slower as they must sum across all internal counters
  *
  * On the JVM, this is implemented using `java.util.concurrent.atomic.LongAdder`, while other platforms use equivalent specialized
  * implementations.
  *
  * Ideal for:
  *   - High-throughput statistics collection
  *   - Concurrent request counters
  *   - Performance monitoring systems
  *   - Any scenario with many updates and fewer reads
  *
  * @see
  *   [[kyo.AtomicLong]] Alternative with immediate visibility of updates and faster reads, but slower writes under contention.

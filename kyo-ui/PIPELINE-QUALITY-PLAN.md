# Pipeline Quality Plan

Goal: all pipeline code is **correct, simple, safe, readable, and modular**.

This plan covers `kyo-ui/shared/src/main/scala/kyo/internal/tui2/pipeline/` and establishes standards for all future phases.

---

## Principles

These are non-negotiable for all pipeline code — current and future phases.

### Types over primitives
- **Use `Length` for all dimensional values** — widths, padding, margins, gaps, offsets, radii. Use `Length` (can be `Auto`/`Pct`/`Px`/`Em`) for values that need parent context, `Length.Px` for values that are always resolved pixels. Use `N.px`, `N.pct` extension methods in tests and usage code.
- **Use `PackedColor` for all colors** — opaque type over `Int`. Use `PackedColor(r, g, b)` to construct, `.r`/`.g`/`.b` extensions to extract. Use `PackedColor.Transparent` not `-1`.
- **Use `FlatStyle`** (not `ComputedStyle`) for the resolved style type.
- **Use enums for all categorical values** — `Style.FlexDirection`, `Style.Alignment`, `Style.Justification`, etc. Never store as `Int` ordinals. Match on enum variants, never compare `.ordinal`.
- **Use `Maybe[T]` for absent values** — never sentinel ints like `-1`, `-2`, `Int.MinValue`.

### Logic belongs to its type
- **Methods that operate on a type belong to that type**, not to consumers. If multiple pipeline stages need the same operation on a value, it's a method on the type.
  - `Length.resolve`, `Length.resolveOrAuto`, `Length.toPx` — resolution is about what `Length` means
  - `Rect.intersect` — intersection is geometry, not layout algorithm
  - `PackedColor.fromStyle`, `.r`/`.g`/`.b` — color operations belong to the color type
- **Prefer instance methods** over companion object functions when the method operates on a single value of the type.
- **Don't create private wrapper aliases** — if a method moves to a type, update all call sites directly. No `private def resolve(...) = Length.resolve(...)`.

### Control flow
- **No `while`, `var` for loop control, or `return`** — use `@tailrec def loop`. Local `var` is acceptable only for building up an immutable result in bounded scope.
- **No `asInstanceOf`** — pattern match instead.

### Readability
- **One statement per line** — no semicolons joining statements.
- **No magic numbers** — every non-obvious literal gets a named constant, a typed value, or an inline comment explaining the value.
- **Comments explain "why" (domain constraints), not "what" (restating code).**
- **Protocol/encoding details behind named methods** — no raw byte sequences inline in business logic (see Differ's `enableBold`, `writeFgColor`, etc.).
- **Descriptive intermediate names** — `afterAttrs`, `afterFg`, not `sgr2`, `sgr3`.
- **Reduce parameter explosion** — use nested defs to close over invariant parameters in recursive helpers.

### Layout contract
- **`available` rect is authoritative** — when `arrange` is called, the `available` rect represents the size assigned by the parent (flex, table, or viewport). The child's declared size is only used during intrinsic measurement.
- **`resolveAvailable`** bridges explicit sizes to the available rect — called at the root and for overlays to resolve the node's declared size before passing to `arrange`.
- **Flex measurement resolves percentages** — `measureFlexChildren` resolves percentage sizes against the parent content dimensions, not against `Int.MaxValue`.

## Completed improvements

All items below are done and tested (245 tests passing).

### `Length` type (replaces `SizeEnc`)
- Created `kyo-ui/shared/src/main/scala/kyo/Length.scala` — standalone ADT with `Px | Pct | Em | Auto`
- `Length.resolve`, `Length.resolveOrAuto`, `Length.toPx` — resolution logic on the type, not in consumers
- Removed `Style.Size` from `Style.scala` — all references use `Length` directly
- 27 `FlatStyle` fields typed as `Length` or `Length.Px`
- Deleted `SizeEnc` — no more fragile Int encoding for sizes
- Styler assigns `Length` directly, uses `Length.toPx` for `Length.Px` fields
- Layout calls `Length.resolve` / `Length.resolveOrAuto` — no overflow bugs

### `PackedColor` opaque type (replaces `ColorEnc`)
- Opaque type `PackedColor = Int` with `CanEqual`
- 11 color fields + `gradientStops` + `Cell.fg/bg` + `ResolvedTheme.fg/bg` typed
- Extension methods `.r`, `.g`, `.b`, `.raw` for extraction
- `PackedColor.fromStyle` for conversion from `Style.Color`
- Deleted `ColorEnc` entirely

### `FlatStyle` (replaces `ComputedStyle`)
- Renamed type and all field references (`computed` → `style`)
- 12 enum-typed fields (not Int ordinals)
- `gradientDirection: Maybe[Style.GradientDirection]` replaces `Int` with 0=absent encoding
- FontWeight uses explicit match instead of `.ordinal` comparison

### `Rect.intersect` instance method
- Moved from Layout private helper to Rect instance method — geometry belongs to the geometry type

### Layout correctness
- `arrange` uses `available` as authoritative parent-assigned size
- `resolveAvailable` bridges explicit sizes to available rects
- `measureFlexChildren` resolves percentage sizes against parent dimensions
- Auto-width children in cross axis fill parent when intrinsic size is 0
- `categorizeChildren` uses nested `@tailrec def loop` (3 params vs 13)
- `layoutOverlayChildren` uses pattern match instead of `asInstanceOf`

### Differ type safety
- `TermState.fg/bg: Maybe[PackedColor]` — no sentinel values
- `TermState.cursorPos: Maybe[(Int, Int)]` — no `-1` sentinel
- Named ANSI primitives (`enableBold`, `resetAllAttributes`, `moveCursorTo`)

### Other
- `WidgetKey.child` — instance method, not companion object function
- `ImageData.bytes` — `Span[Byte]` not `IArray[Byte]`
- `Cursor.wait_` → `Cursor.await` (conflicts with `Object.wait`)

## Standards for future phases

When implementing Phases 3 (Lower), 6 (Painter), 8 (Dispatch), 9 (Pipeline), 10 (Integration):

### Before writing code
1. Read the Principles section above — every principle is non-negotiable
2. Ask: does this logic belong to the type or to the consumer?
3. Use `Length` for dimensions, `PackedColor` for colors, enums for categories, `Maybe` for absence
4. Use `FlatStyle` (not `ComputedStyle`)
5. The IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md pseudocode for unimplemented phases uses `while`/`return`/`Int` ordinals — these are **wrong** and must be rewritten using the patterns established in completed phases

### While writing code
- All iteration via `@tailrec def loop` — no `while`
- One statement per line — no `;`
- Pattern match, not `asInstanceOf`
- Methods that operate on a type go on the type — `Rect.intersect`, `Length.resolve`, etc.
- Instance methods over companion functions when operating on a single value
- Recursive helpers close over invariants via nested defs
- Name intermediates after what changed — `afterAttrs`, `afterFg`, not `state2`, `state3`
- Comments explain domain constraints ("terminals can't turn off individual attributes"), not what code does ("reset and re-emit")
- Protocol/encoding details behind named methods — never inline raw byte writes or bit manipulation in business logic

### Before submitting for review
- All tests pass (existing + new)
- No raw `Int` for colors/sizes/enums anywhere in the diff
- No `.ordinal`, sentinel values, `while`, `return`, `asInstanceOf`, `;`-joined statements
- No private wrappers that just delegate to a type method — update all call sites directly
- Audit every private helper: could it be an instance method on its primary argument type?
- Audit every `Int` parameter and field: should it be `Length`, `PackedColor`, an enum, or `Maybe[T]`?
- Audit every comment: does it explain "why" or just restate the code?

## How to handle user feedback

### TODOs in code
- The user adds TODO comments as feedback — these are instructions, not suggestions
- Address every TODO. Don't decide on your own what a TODO means — if ambiguous, present options and wait
- Don't rename things, change field names, or restructure code beyond what the TODO asks without presenting the plan first
- After addressing a TODO, remove it — don't leave comments about intermediate development state

### When the user says to do something
- Do it. Don't propose alternatives, don't add caveats, don't do half the work and ask if they want the rest
- If the change is mechanical (rename, replace all occurrences), do ALL occurrences including tests, plan files, and documentation — no laziness, no "these are just pseudocode"
- Don't create wrapper aliases for backward compatibility unless explicitly asked
- Don't leave stale references anywhere — grep and fix everything

### When making design decisions
- Present options and wait for the user's choice — don't pick one and implement it
- If the user has established a pattern (e.g., enums over ordinals, instance methods over companions), follow it without being told each time
- If you notice an opportunity to improve quality (like moving logic to its type), raise it and wait for approval before implementing
- Never diverge from the user's design — if they say "use Length", use Length everywhere, not "Length in some places and Int aliases in others"

### Quality bar
- The code should get MORE readable and safe with each change, never less
- Every change is an opportunity to raise quality — don't just fix the immediate issue, look for the pattern and apply it consistently
- If tests are failing, fix the root cause in the code, not in the test expectations — unless the test itself is wrong
- When in doubt about whether something is good enough, it isn't — do the thorough version

## What stays as plain `Int`

These are justified — they represent actual counts or pixel coordinates, not encoded values:

- `Rect(x, y, w, h)` — resolved pixel coordinates
- `ImageData.width/height` — pixel dimensions
- `CellGrid.width/height` — grid dimensions
- `Handlers.colspan/rowspan` — grid span counts
- `Cursor.charOffset` — character index
- `FlatStyle.lineHeight` — integer multiplier
- `FlatStyle.scrollTop/Left` — pixel offsets
- `Handlers.tabIndex: Maybe[Int]` — focus order

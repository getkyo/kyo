/** Reactive change notification. Transport-agnostic; each backend renders in its own format.
  *
  * `region` identifies the reactive boundary being updated and `contentContext`/`parentContext` carry the
  * structural context the renderer needs to keep the produced HTML valid where it lands (see
  * [[ReactiveRegion]]).
  *
  * `previous` is the tree this region last rendered, `Absent` on its first render. A backend that can address
  * a nested node uses it to send only the parts that moved (see [[UIDiff]]); one that cannot ignores it and
  * re-sends the region.
